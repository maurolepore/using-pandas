# Using pandas 

[bit.ly/mauro-using-pandas](https://bit.ly/mauro-using-pandas)

This tutorial is about pandas, a python library for multiple phases of the data science workflow.

## Objectives

* Perform a variety of data science tasks on a real-world dataset using pandas.
* Learn how to avoid either a pandas pitfall or a data science pitfall. 
* Become more confident using pandas.

## Requirements

You will get the most out of this tutorial if you are an intermediate pandas user, since the tutorial will not cover pandas basics. 

* [Refresh how to do stuff with pandas](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/justmarkham/pandas-videos/blob/master/pandas.ipynb).
* [Cheetsheets](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/topics/cheat-sheets/).

## Data
